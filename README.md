# PasswordGenerator
A site that generates a secure password based on criteria selected by the user.

## Description
This site is to generate a random password using a set of criteria from the user.  When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, the user is presented with a popup
dialog box that looks for the length of the password between 8 and 125 characters.  As well as the types of characters found in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numbers 
and special characters).  The user is required to enter a length and select at least one character type for the password.  If the user does not meet these conditions, the 
user will be met with an error message.  If the user meets the requirements, clicking submit, will then close the popup window and proceed with generating the password 
and displaying it in the window provided.  

## Usage

## Credits
I learned quite a bit with this project.  The following sites I copied code to implement this project:

  1. The password generator function was copied from Foolish Developer on their blog article called: _Random Password Generator using Javascript_
     https://dev.to/code_mystery/random-password-generator-using-javascript-6a
  2. The algorithm to determine if at least one of the checkboxes was checked was found in a blog article by Borislav Hadzhiev called: _Javascript: making sure at least one Checkbox is Checked_
     https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/select-at-least-one-checkbox-javascript

Other sources I used for the site development are the following:
  * w3Schools HTML Forms - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp
  * w3Schools HTML Form Elements - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp
